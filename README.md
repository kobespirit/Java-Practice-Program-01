==================================================

1. Write a program Welcome.java that expects two string command line arguments, a first name and a second name. The program prints out
on one line \Hello first second.", and on the next line, \Is that first SECOND or FIRST second?" where first and second are the first and
second command line arguments, and FIRST and SECOND are the first and second arguments printed in all upper case letters. Do not print any
extra spaces, even at the beginning or ends of the lines. Do not worry about too many or too few command line arguments. For example, if the command line arguments are \Joe" and \Blow", the program should print out:

Hello Joe Blow.
Is that Joe BLOW or JOE Blow?

2. Write a program Circle.java that prints out the area of a circle whose diameter is specified as the only command line argument. The result should be formatted with four digits after the decimal point, and no extra characters or spaces before the decimal point. Donâ€™t include any extra characters in the output. The command line argument may be written as an integer or as a floating point number. Do not worry about too many or too few command line arguments, or the command line argument not being a number. For example, if the command line argument is specified as 2, the output should look like:

3.1416
